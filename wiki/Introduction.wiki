#summary Introduction to using the examples and general flow of the project.

The purpose of this project is to have a comprehensive place to host Map/Reduce examples with related Data Sets that start out simple and then go on to more complex examples that exploit the Hadoop Map/Reduce technology.


== Getting Started ==
